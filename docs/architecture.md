# System Architecture

## 1. Overview
The platform will follow a **monolithic Next.js architecture** with **API Routes** handling server-side logic.  
The database layer will use **PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM**.  
Authentication will be managed by **NextAuth.js**.  
UI components will leverage **shadcn/ui** for consistency and reusability.

## 2. High-Level Architecture
[ Next.js Frontend + Backend API Routes ]
|
| Prisma ORM
|
[ PostgreSQL Database ]
## 3. Components
### Frontend
- Next.js pages & components
- TailwindCSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI primitives (buttons, modals, forms, dropdowns)

### Authentication
- NextAuth.js for sessions & OAuth
- JWT-based session handling
- PostgreSQL for user persistence

### Backend
- Next.js API Routes
- Product CRUD operations
- Vote & comment system

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- Users
- Products
- Votes
- Comments
- Notifications
- Categories/Tags

### Deployment
- Vercel (Next.js hosting)
- Supabase / Railway for PostgreSQL
- Edge CDN for static assets

## 4. Data Flow
1. User signs up → stored in PostgreSQL via NextAuth.
2. User submits product → API route validates and saves.
3. User upvotes → vote entry saved in PostgreSQL.
4. Homepage feed queries trending products.
5. Notifications generated for new interactions.
